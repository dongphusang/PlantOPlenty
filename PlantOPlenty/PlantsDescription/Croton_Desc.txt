	Croton, also called “garden croton,” are native to the tropical forests of southeast Asia and Oceania.

	In the wild, they grow as large shrubs, reaching up to 10 feet tall (in the home or garden, they stay a lot smaller).

	All parts of this plant are poisonous—especially the seeds—so it is not recommended for use in homes with curious pets or children.
