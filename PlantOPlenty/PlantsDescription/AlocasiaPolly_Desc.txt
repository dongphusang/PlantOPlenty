	Dramatic leaves make the Alocasia Polly a desirable plant, perfect for Aroid collectors (and plant lovers in general!). 
	
	A rhizomatous evergreen perennial, it features leaves with arrowhead shape that can grow quite large spanning anywhere from 1-10 inches in width and 1-20 inches in length. 
	
	The edges are wavy and outlined in light green to cream which makes a stark contrast to the dark green leaves. While a compact plant, great for indoor spaces, the plant can grow overall to about 3 feet high and 3 feet wide.
