	Did you know the colorful “flowers” of the Anthurium are actually modified leaves? The true flowers of the plant grow from the center structure called an inflorescence. 

	Originally found in areas of the Andes Mountains range in Colombia and Equador, this beauty enjoys a warm spot in your home with a bit of extra humidity.

	Anthuriums are toxic to pets and humans. Typically, ingestion will cause mouth and skin irritation, stomach pain and irritation with possible vomiting.
